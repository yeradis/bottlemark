**Your code is STUPID! **  
My code is **STUPID**!
Almost all of the code around the world is **STUPID**!

And if you get offended, is a good thing.

I know nobody likes to hear their code is **STUPID**. Me neither!

But you have to swallow your pride.

Dont get me wrong, i´m saying that your code is **STUPID**, not you!

How to detect if your code is **STUPID **?

What characterizes **STUPID **code? What makes code **STUPID**?

**STUPID**

**S** ingleton  
**T** ight coupling  
**U** ntestability  
**P** remature Optimization  
**I** ndescriptive Naming  
**D** uplication

If you can find those patterns in your code, then your code is **STUPID**.

How to make your code don't be **STUPID**?

To achieve this, what you need is a **SOLID** **GRASP**!

Yes! **SOLID **and **GRASP**

A collection of Object-oriented design principles for “good code”.

**SOLID**

**S** ingle responsibility principle  
**O** pen/closed principle  
**L** iskov substitution principle  
**I** nterface segregation principle  
**D** ependency inversion principle

**GRASP**

**G** eneral  
**R** esponsibility  
**A** ssignment  
**S** oftware  
**P** atterns (or Principles)

The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are: Controller, Creator, Indirection, Information Expert, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, Polymorphism, Protected Variations, and Pure Fabrication.

With that information, its time for SMART coding!
